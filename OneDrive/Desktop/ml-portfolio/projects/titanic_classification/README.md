# ML Portfolio by Mrganga05

Welcome to my machine learning portfolio repository! This repo contains practical projects with code, notebooks, and explanations demonstrating end-to-end ML workflows.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks or Colab for exploration and model building
- `projects/` - Python scripts for each machine learning project
- `data/` - Raw and processed datasets
- `models/` - Stored trained models
- `deploy/` - Deployment files (APIs, Docker, etc.)
- `results/` - Output plots, evaluation reports, and saved figures

## Titanic Survival Prediction Project

- **Description:**  
  Predict passenger survival on the Titanic shipwreck using Logistic Regression and Random Forest classification models.

- **Files:**  
  - Notebook: [`notebooks/titanic_project.ipynb`](notebooks/titanic_project.ipynb)  
  - Script: [`projects/titanic_script.py`](projects/titanic_script.py)  

- **Key Tasks:**  
  - Data exploration and cleaning  
  - Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables  
  - Feature engineering (family size, age groups)  
  - Model training, evaluation, and comparison

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/Mrganga05/ml-portfolio.git

2. Install required Python packages:  
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebooks or scripts to explore the projects.

## Future Work

- Add more diverse ML projects, including regression, clustering, and time series forecasting.  
- Implement deep learning workflows and NLP projects.  
- Package projects with Docker and create APIs for deployment.
