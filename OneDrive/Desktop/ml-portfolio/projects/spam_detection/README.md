# Spam Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to classify emails as spam (unwanted) or ham (normal) using machine learning techniques. We use a Logistic Regression model trained on a dataset of labeled emails.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains text messages/emails labeled as `spam` or `ham`.
- Data is preprocessed to convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/spam_detection.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with full exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
- `projects/spam_detection/train.py` (optional) — Python script to train and save the model.
- `projects/spam_detection/predict_example.py` (optional) — Script demonstrating predictions using the trained model.
- `projects/spam_detection/README.md` (this file) — Documentation explaining the project.

## How to Run

1. Install required packages (if not installed):

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn notebook

text

2. Open and run the notebook for full analysis and model training:

jupyter notebook notebooks/spam_detection.ipynb

text

3. To run scripts (if available), use:

python projects/spam_detection/train.py
python projects/spam_detection/predict_example.py

text

## Results

- Training and test accuracy scores are printed in the notebook.
- Custom email samples can be tested for spam or ham classification.
